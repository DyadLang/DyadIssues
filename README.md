DyadIssues is a stub Github repository for reporting issues on Dyad. 

## When should this repository be used, instead of support@juliahub.com?

This repository should be used for usage discussion / help, bug reports, and feedback.
Any items related to licensing, setting up JuliaHub instances, etc. should instead be
taken to [our contact form](https://juliahub.com/company/contact-us-dyad).

## Is my issue being looked at?

Much of the tracking happens internally on private repositories, whose discussions will
not be available publicly. However, this does not mean your issue has no activity!
We will share information as the issue progresses.
